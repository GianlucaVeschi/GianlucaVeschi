### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software developer from Italy currently working as Junior Android Developer at Thalia in Berlin (Germany).
  
âš¡ I have been developing actively since 2018 and have since then worked in Hamburg (Germany) and Shanghai (China).

ðŸŒ± Currently improving my Kotlin skills for Android Development

ðŸ”­ I will graduate in November 2020 with a thesis called "Assembly and Design of FPV Quadcopters for Healthcare Applications during the Covid pandemic"

âš¡ Fun fact: When I was 14 I won the Italian Rubik's Cube Championship for the 7x7x7 and held that record until 2013. Speedcubing taught me a lot about self-learning and algorithmic thinking.
